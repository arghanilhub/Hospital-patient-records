<h3>Situation</h3> 
<hr> 

Massachusetts General Hospital has been observing a steady increase in patient admissions over the past decade, and hospital administrators are keen on understanding key trends in their **patient population**, **medical procedures**, and **insurance coverage**. As a data analyst, I have been brought in to conduct a deep dive into the hospital’s records from 2011 to 2022. </br> 
<br>  

**The Hospital’s Concern:** <br> 
Hospital leadership has identified several pressing concerns that require data-driven insights: </br> 

* **Insurance Coverage & Payer Analysis –** With multiple insurance companies covering patient procedures, the hospital wants to understand which insurers provide better coverage for critical treatments. Are there any gaps in coverage that patients frequently struggle with? </br>
  
* **Pressing medical issues -** Analyzing the most pressing medical issues bringing patients to the hospital—whether there’s been a recent surge or if it’s been a long-term trend. </br>

* **Procedure Trends & Future Planning –** The hospital needs to know which medical procedures generates the most revenue for the hospital and which one has been performed the most. What kind of medical procedures associated with some critical issues ? This helps identify the most common health concerns and what resources should be stocked accordingly. </br>

* **Patient Flow –** Were there any specific years when patient admissions spiked based on any perticular health issue? Is there any re-admission trends? </br> 

By uncovering key patterns in their patient records, holspital can make data-driven decisions for operational efficiency, financial planning, and future preparedness. My analysis will provide actionable insights, allowing them to : </br> 

* Negotiate better deals with insurance companies. </br>
* Analyzing critical threats for coming-days and resource planning based on that. </br>
* Ensure adequate staffing and equipment availability for common medical procedures. </br>
* re-admission with same issue, could indicate gaps in care; if different, it may suggest strong patient trust in the hospital. </br>
